# Feather

Feather is a lightweight, modular API gateway library for Go.
It provides a simple and flexible framework for building gateways tailored to your specific needs, 
with a pluggable architecture that supports custom authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

## Goals
- Easy to import and configure (`go get` compatible).  
- Minimal runtime overhead.  
- Provider-agnostic auth.  
- Tests, examples, and simple benchmarks included.
