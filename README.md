# GoKeeper 

GoKeeper is a lightweight, modular API Gateway library for Go.  
It provides routing, authentication hooks, rate limiting, logging,and request proxying.  
Designed to be pluggable so you can bring your own auth provider and policies.

## Goals
- Easy to import and configure (`go get` compatible).  
- Minimal runtime overhead.  
- Provider-agnostic auth and middleware.  
- Tests, examples, and simple benchmarks included.
